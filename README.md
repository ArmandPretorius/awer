<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Awer is an Android application that is a closed-group chat application for a company who wants to keep their private information safe.

This Project is for my Term 2 major subject, Interactive Development, for which we were tasked to create a fimiliar chat app using Xamarin.Forms and Firebase.  Not anyone should be allowed to access the application and it should have a unique way of joining the conversation.
